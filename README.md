#A new feature added:
- for each single product i had a gallery, so you can change for example the colors of the product based on the images under the primary image
- ok let's call that the secondary images
- the secondary images was fine, i was maping through 3 assests
- but the problem i had with the secondary images is when the array have 4 or more the ui gone crazy
- so this solution i came with fixes that, which is make it sroll/swipe able.
